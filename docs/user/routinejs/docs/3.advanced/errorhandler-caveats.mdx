There are some caveats and gotchas that you have to understand and take care of while developing the application and relying on Routine’s error handling.

Let’s start with the infamous `errorHandler` global function which is like a global `try catch` block for your application

That sounds good, what’s the catch (pun not intended) ?!

Well, let’s start with some code examples and work our way down from there

:::tip
This would work fine
:::
```jsx
const Routine = require('routinejs')
const app = new Routine({
    catchErrors: true
})

app.get('/user',
    (req, res) => {
        try {
            throw new Error("something")
        } catch (e) {
            console.log('catch')
        }
    })

const server = app.listen(8080)
```

Well, since the error being thrown inside `/user` route controller is `synchronous` in nature, it’s handling would be transferred to it’s `try catch` block, and if that block is not present, then handling would be transferred to the `errorHandler` function, given that `catchErrors` value is not explicitly set to `false`

:::danger
But something like this would not work
:::
```jsx
const Routine = require('routinejs')
const app = new Routine({
    catchErrors: true
})

app.get('/user',
    (req, res) => {
        try {
						//async error
						Promise.reject("promise rejected")
        } catch (e) {
            console.log('catch')
        }
    })

const server = app.listen(8080)
```

The reason it won’t work is that when dealing with `async errors` inside `Routine`, you have two options, deal with those errors yourself by setting `catchErrors` value to `false` , or let `Routine` do it for you with it’s global error handler called `errorHandler` in the `Routine` constructor.

:::caution
While designing the library, we had to take some assumptions into account, one of which is that if `catchErrors` is `true`, it means there are very minimal `try catch` blocks present in the user’s code base.
:::

If for some reason you do **not** want the `errorHandler` to take control of a specific `async` error, you have to chain a `.catch` method directly to the `Promise`

:::tip
This example will work fine
:::
```jsx
const Routine = require('routinejs')
const app = new Routine({
    catchErrors: true
})

app.get('/user',
    (req, res) => {
				Promise.reject("promise rejected").catch((err) => res.json("inside catch"))
    })

const server = app.listen(8080)
```

Now the ownership of the error above would not be passed to `errorHandler` but rather it’s chained `.catch` methods, same goes if you have a `Promise rejection` inside a chained `.catch`

### Now, let’s talk about `errorHandler` in a bit more detail

`errorHandler` function is supposed to act like a global `try catch` , but what if an `error` occurs inside this function itself

glad you asked, let’s dissect this problem

Let’s deal with `synchronous` errors first…

`errorHandler` will not catch `sync` errors happening inside it’s own body without a proper `try catch` system in place, this is done deliberately to avoid infinite loops of `errorHandler` execution (this happens though when we are talking about `async` errors)

:::danger
For example, this program will crash
:::

```jsx
const Routine = require('routinejs')
const app = new Routine({
    catchErrors: true,
		errorHandler: (error, req, res) => {
				//this will cause the program to crash
				throw new Error("causing crash here")
		}
})

app.get('/user',
    (req, res) => {
				//error so that we can go into errorHandler body above
				throw new Error("sync error")
    })

const server = app.listen(8080)
```
:::tip
To fix the above program, simply wrap the `errorHandler` body in a `try catch`
:::
```jsx
errorHandler: (error, req, res) => {
		try{
				//now, catch will be called
				throw new Error("this won't crash now")
		}catch(e){
				console.log(e)
		}
}
```

### Things are not so simple when talking about `async` errors

There are scenarios where the program can go in an **infinite code execution loop** because of `async` errors happening inside `errorHandler`

:::danger
This program will go in an infinite loop of `errorHandler`
:::
```jsx
const Routine = require('routinejs')
const app = new Routine({
    catchErrors: true,
		errorHandler: (error, req, res) => {
				console.log('error handler called')
        try {
            setTimeout(() => {
                throw new Error(err)
            }, 500)
        } catch (e) {
            console.log('catch')
        }
		}
})

app.get('/user',
    (req, res) => {
				//error so that we can go into errorHandler body above
				throw new Error("sync error")
    })

const server = app.listen(8080)
```

Notice, even though we have a `try catch` in place inside `errorHandler`, the program itself will keep printing `error handler called` message, that is because of the phenomenon we learned earlier in the article, when we have an `async` error in place and `catchErrors` is set to `true` , we need explicit chaining of `.catch` otherwise `try catch` is of no use.

:::tip
This program will NOT crash
:::
```jsx
const Routine = require('routinejs')
const app = new Routine({
    catchErrors: true,
		errorHandler: (error, req, res) => {
				Promise.reject("inside error handler").catch((e) => res.json(e))
		}
})

app.get('/user',
    (req, res) => {
				//error so that we can go into errorHandler body above
				throw new Error("sync error")
    })

const server = app.listen(8080)
```

This will cause the program to send the error as `json` to the user because that’s what we are doing inside the `.catch` method
