Routing is very simple in `Routine` just like it is in `Express` , but without the extra bloat

There are 5 `http` verb methods available to be used

`get` , `post` , `put` , `patch` & `delete`

All of the above accept same amount parameters,

1. A path string such as `/xyz`
2. Comma separated handlers such as

    ```jsx
    app.get(`/xyz`, (req, res) => {
        //route functionality
    })
    ```

    The last route function is called `main route handler` and any number of functions before it are called `middlewares`

    :::info

    The concept of `middlewares` in `Routine` is same as it is in `Express` , But it has some extra functionality present in them

    If you are not familiar with this concept, donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ll understand the workings of `middleware` later in the docs

    For now, letâ€™s just focus on simple routing

    :::

Inside the `handler` you have the full power of `Nodejs` available to you with some `extra` methods, such as `.json` and `.status`

```jsx
app.get(`/xyz`, (req, res) => {
    //This will send a response to client and end the response cycle
    res.status(200).json({
        hello: 'world?',
    })
    //This is same as above code, but shorter
    //res.json({
    //  "hello": "world?"
    //})
})
```

And the above code will work with all other `http` verbs mentioned at the start ðŸ˜€
