### What is clustering?!

When building a production application, you are usually on the lookout for ways to optimize its performance while keeping any possible trade-offs in mind. we'll take a look at an approach that can give you a quick win when it comes to improving the way your Node.js apps handle the workload.

An instance of Node.js runs in a single thread which means that on a multi-core system (which most computers are these days), not all cores will be utilized by the app. To take advantage of the other available cores, you can launch a cluster of Node.js processes and distribute the load between them.

Having multiple threads to handle requests improves the throughput (requests/second) of your server as several clients can be served concurrently. We'll see how to create child processes with the Node.js
cluster module and then later, we'll take a look at how to manage clustering with the PM2 Process Manager.

`Routine` is fully compatible with `Nodejs cluster module`

Below is a minimal viable example to work with in `cluster module`

```js
const Routine = require('routinejs')
const cluster = require("cluster");
const totalCPUs = require("os").cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
    console.log(`Number of CPUs is ${totalCPUs}`);
    console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);

    // Fork workers.
    for (let i = 0; i < totalCPUs; i++) {
        cluster.fork();
    }

    cluster.on("exit", (worker, code, signal) => {
        console.log(`worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
        console.log("Let's fork another worker!");
        cluster.fork();
    });
} else {
    const app = new Routine({
        enableBodyParsing: true,
        catchErrors: true,
    })

    app.get('/user',
        (req, res) => {
            res.json("worked :D")
        })

    app.listen(8080)
}
```
