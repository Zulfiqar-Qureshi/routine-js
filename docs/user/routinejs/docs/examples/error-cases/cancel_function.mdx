description: how to not use cancel function
slug: cancel-function

`catchErrors` boolean and `errorHandler` function work Alright in most cases
but there are edge cases as well which can cause the application to freeze or crash
One of those cases is this, we have a simple `GET` route to `/some_path` and it has a middleware,
which for some reason cancels the request by calling `cancel` function.

:::caution
The `cancel` function after running your callback and other necessary things, calls the `res.end` function
to properly end the response cycle, however, `res.end` in itself is a response from server, after which we
should not and cannot send another response back to the client.
One more important thing to note here is that `cancel` DOES NOT halt code execution, it merely ends the request,
So any code or logic set after calling `cancel` would still run.
:::

When we call `next` function after calling `cancel`, it moves the execution forward to the next handler, which
in this case is trying to send a response back to the user, and would fail, now if `catchErrors` value is true,
the framework would detect this and pass this error to the `errorHandler` function, which in turns tries to send a
response back to the client, which would crash the server even though the framework is claiming to catch all errors.

```js
const Routine = require('routinejs')

const app = new Routine({
    enableBodyParsing: true,
    catchErrors: true,

    /**
     * To fix this, either remove `res.json` from below function or do not call `next` after calling `cancel`
     * in the middleware
     * */
    errorHandler: (error, req, res) => {
        res.json({
            message: error.stack,
        })
    },
})

function middleware(req, res, next, cancel) {
    cancel('Cancelled because of something', (req) =>
        console.log('request cancelled')
    )
    next()
}

app.get('/some_path', middleware, (req, res) => {
    res.json({
        message: req.params.name,
    })
})

app.listen(8080)
```
