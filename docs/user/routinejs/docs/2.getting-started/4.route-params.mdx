:::danger Important
- `RegExp` special characters can only be used in a parameter
    - `Express.js 4.x` supported `RegExp` special characters regardless of position - this is considered a bug
- Parameters have suffixes that augment meaning - ``, `+` and `?`. E.g. `/:user*`
- No wildcard asterisk (``) - use parameters instead (`(.*)` or `:splat*`)

Not all routes from `Express.js 4.x` are compatible with `Routine` , simply because there are some corner cases in express which are

considered as `bugs` by the community and sometimes does not follow regex rules

`Routine` however does not have any special path syntax other than `named params` and it supports any valid `regex`

:::

### Simple usage

Consider the following snippet

```jsx
app.get(`/:name`, (req,res)=> {})
```

We are registering a route which kind of an odd string as the `url` , simply put, while registering routes, anything put after the `:` is considered a `named param` which means they have some kind of meaning

and `Routine` should extract itâ€™s value which request route match is found.

So, if i try to visit `[localhost:8080/zulfiqar](http://localhost:8080/zulfiqar)` the `req.params` object will contain a key named `name` and value as `zulfiqar`

### Advancing

```jsx
app.get(`/:name/:lastname/:contactnumber`, (req,res)=> {})

//will match something like
/zulfiqar/ali/7079787907 <-- not my real contact tho
```

The above behavior can be combined with more `named params` and `req.params` will contain those values if match is found

### More advance

Any valid `Regex` can be used instead of passing a string in route registration phase

For example, this is a valid `GET` path

```jsx
This route path will match butterfly and dragonfly, but not butterflyman, dragonflyman, and so on.

app.get(/.*fly$/, (req, res) => {
  res.send('/.*fly$/')
})
```

### Wildcard

A wildcard route `(.*)` should be registered as a fallback for when no route match is found by `Routine`

```jsx
This route will match anything

app.get(`(.*)`, (req, res) => {
  res.send('/.*fly$/')
})
```

Note that this route should be registered at the very last, putting it at first or in-between might result in some lost routes.
