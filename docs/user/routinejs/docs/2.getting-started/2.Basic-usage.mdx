:::info
`Routine` is very similar to `Express` in it’s workings,
there are some hidden features in `Routine` which we’ll talk about later
that makes this a compelling alternative to `Express`.
:::

To get started, we first have to `require` routine and initialize an object from `Routine` class

```jsx
const Routine = require('@juniordev/routinejs')

//getting an instance of Routine class with all the superpowers
//highlight-next-line
const app = new Routine()
```

To start listening for requests, we need to utilize `listen` method in the `Routine instance` which in this condition, is `app` variable.

```jsx
const Routine = require('@juniordev/routinejs')
const app = new Routine()

//This is enough viable code to start listening for incoming requests
//highlight-next-line
app.listen()
```

`.listen` method has two parameters and have good defaults for both of them.

`.listen(port = 8080, callback = (port) => log(port))`

After calling `app.listen` , you can run your `js` file and you should see this

```shell
/$$$$$$$                        /$$     /$$                        /$$$$$  /$$$$$$
| $$__  $$                      | $$    |__/                       |__  $$ /$$__  $$
| $$  \ $$  /$$$$$$  /$$   /$$ /$$$$$$   /$$ /$$$$$$$   /$$$$$$       | $$| $$  \__/
