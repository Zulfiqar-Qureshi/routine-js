As a long time `Nodejs` developer, i really love `Express` and the influence it has over the
community, the syntax is simple yet expressive (pun intended)

Express offers a lot of flexibility and features, and maybe a little too much
Sometimes i don't have need for such features other than routing and a few extra things
The features `Express` offers comes at a very large cost of performance

That inspired me to create `Routine`, a simple router that does not get into your way
and let you use raw nodejs features without much overhead, it's super lightweight and features
almost full compatibility with existing `express middlewares`

That's it, even the inspiration is simple eh?!
